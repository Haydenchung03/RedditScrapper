1. Make it so that when a user gives us their username and password, it logs a session so we do not need to log in and out each time. 
This is to prevent us from maxing out on the number of requests we can make
    - Use this link to do that: https://adw0rd.github.io/instagrapi/usage-guide/interactions.html


2. Make is so user can upload to feed. We are getting error on instagramUpload.py where user cannot automate the upload to feed (FIXED SOMEWHAT)
3. Automate it so that it reads files from videos and just takes that link in instagramUpload.py
4. Make it so videos that are longer than 1 minute do not get downloaded and uploaded
